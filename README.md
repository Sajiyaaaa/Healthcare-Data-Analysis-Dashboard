# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project analyzes healthcare data to uncover patterns in patient demographics, stay duration, and disease outcomes using Power BI. The dashboard provides meaningful insights for hospital management and patient care optimization.


## 📊 Project Overview

The **Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard** aims to:

- Understand patient demographics (age, gender, region)
  
- Analyze **average hospital stay duration**
  
- Identify **top diseases by admission count**
  
- Evaluate **treatment effectiveness**
  
- Monitor **hospital performance metrics**


## 🧠 Key Insights

- 🧍‍♂️ Majority of patients belong to the **40–60 age group**
  
- 🏥 **Cardiology and Orthopedics** are the most frequent departments
  
- ⏱️ Average hospital stay: **4.5 days**
  
- 📈 Female patients have a slightly higher admission rate
  
- 💰 Treatment costs are higher in urban hospitals


## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** — for visualization and DAX analysis
  
- **Excel / CSV Dataset** — data cleaning and import
  
- **DAX** — to calculate metrics like stay duration and average cost
